# UTIMCOCodingExercise

This project is a coding exercise which demonstrates coding style & project delivery per the following requirements:

Given a JSON string which describes a menu, calculate the SUM of the IDs of all "items", as long as a "label" exists for that item.

Input - Your program should somehow take a file (or path to a file) as input. The given sample JSON string can be found [here](UTIMCOCodingExercise.Web/wwwroot/data/samplemenu.json).

All IDs are integers between 0 and 100. The menu can be of any length.

Sample Output:

46

0

248

Additional Instructions & Tips

* Post your solution to GitHub

* Choose your weapon: Use whatever platform, tools, language(s) and coding environment you like.

* Command-line apps, Web apps, APIs, and fat-client solutions are all equally valid, so choose whatever you are most comfortable with (or whichever best showcases your talents)

* Write testable code and include tests in your solution

* Make sure your solution is easy to build, run, test, and deploy (instructions are always nice. TIP: Include a useful Readme)

## Getting Started

Follow this guide to get this project running on your machine.


### Prerequisites

These instructions assume you are running Visual Studio 2019. You can go [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for the Visual Studio 2019 download. The "Community" Visual Studio is free and will allow you to run this project.

This application has a Target framework of .NET Core 3.1.


### Installing

1) Start by creating an empty directory (folder) on your machine where you'd like to put the project.

2) Once that is created, clone the project to your machine by following the instructions found [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/clone-project-with-visual-studio-2019/). 


If there is a need to replace the json string file,

1) Give the replacement file the name "samplemenu.json"

2) Replace the current sample menu file by either moving or copying your new file into the following directory of this project after cloning it to your machine:

    UTIMCOCodingExercise\UTIMCOCodingExercise.Web\wwwroot\data

Once the project is on your machine, Open Visual Studio and select "Open a Project or Solution" from the options on the right. 

## Running the tests

With the solution open in Visual Studio, open Test Explorer (choose Test on the Visual Studio menu, choose Windows, and then choose Test Explorer) & click the Run All Tests button in the top left corner of Test Explorer (two green triangle arrows).
